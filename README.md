## Description

This webpage was created to showcase the projects I have worked on my career, ways to contact me, and a few tidbits of who I am. It is designed to be a place where potential employers, clients, or partners can see what I've worked on and how I operate. Through this project I learned a lot of CSS and how to style an HTML page. I gained a better understanding of flex, media queries, different unit measurements, and how important is to create classes in your HTML to reduce the redunance of code in CSS. I truly believe I still have a long way to go and think I could utilize some different ways of coding, such as using grid, but overall some progress has been made.
